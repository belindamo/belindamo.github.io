    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am currently a sophomore at Stanford University, majoring in something-or-the-other, likely related to computer science because I've already taken some of those classes. In my opinion, it's also a great field to develop logical thinking and an innovative mindset.  </p>
    <p> My interests are varied and I really enjoy learning cool new skills. Some of my current areas of interest include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> travelling </li>
      <li> sports </li>
      <li> music </li>
      <li> meditation </li>
      <li> public service </li>
    </ul>
    <p> I've been trying to expand my interests into fields such as web development. This website is built completely from scratch by yours truly, and I hope to continue adding things on here as time progresses. It's pretty fun, actually. </p>
    <p> Here's a few of my beliefs: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> We learn today so that we are prepared to learn more tomorrow. </li>
      <li> I believe that the vast majority of people find flaws in others for the things they themselves are insecure about. </li>
      <li> Capitalism promotes gender equality simply because it is more efficient business-wise to have the other half of the population join in the rat race. </li>
      <li> The higher education system has become a business, which puts profit before intellectual vitality. Top tier universities say they emphasize creativity and individualistic thinking when in reality the culture is for students to be funneled into high paying jobs and to be coddled so that we donate our hard-earned slave-labor money back into the cycle. See this <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Excellent-Sheep-Miseducation-American-Meaningful/dp/1476702721/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479981692&sr=8-1&keywords=excellent+sheep"> wonderful book </a> for more details (hit me up if you'd like a pdf :) ). That being said, universities like Stanford have amazing resources and opportunities for their students. It just doesn't matter how many resources that we have, if students are not pursuing them for the sake of their personal fulfillment, and more likely, have not yet learned to think about what personal fulfillment <b> really </b> means to them. </li>
      <li> All lives are equal in the grand scheme of things, because none of us are really that significant in the grand scheme of things. Every person that you will ever meet has the ability to beneficially contribute to society. </li>
      <li> People usually don't like to be changed. That's why it's important to feel sadness, pain, and anguish, because they can be indicators that you need to change something in your life. </li>
      <li> The quality of life we live is based on our paradigm (perspective) in which we see our environment. To be able to control your own paradigm, by widening the gap between the stimulus and response, is to control your own life. </li>
      <li> There are no absolutes, and it is often detrimental when humans act as if there are absolutes. </li>
      <li> The world would be a better place if we all meditated 10 minutes a day in the morning. </li>
    </ol>
