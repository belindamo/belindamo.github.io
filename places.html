    <h2> Places I've Visited </h2>
    <p> I've had the privilege to be able to go to some pretty cool places. I have been lucky to have a family that values immersion into different cultures. My first major memory of a long travelling gig is when I was about 10 years old and my entire family went on a one month tour of China. It was really fun, and I got to learn about all the diverse cultures within China, from Guangzhou to Beijing. As we moved around from place to place, we ate, slept, and explored. </p>
    <p> I grew up in Irvine, California, and I am currently studying at Stanford University. As I have grown up, my family has gradually scattered around the world. My dad currently lives in Guangzhou, China, Vicki (my sister) lives in Paris, Kevin (my brobro) lives in Manhattan, my mom is flying all over to keep in touch with us, and my cat (Meowmeow) has been to most of these places and is currently in Manhattan, New York.  I don't see them too often, but we usually gather during holidays, especially during Christmas break for our annual ski trip with the entire fam (minus our cat). </p>
    <p> I usually have the longest travels during my school breaks, but during high school I also travelled a lot during the school year for competitive fencing. On this list, you'll see a lot of places visited because of fencing, but I don't think they count as much because the vast majority of these were spent fencing in an indoor venue. I added the ones that were significant to me because of the location/meaning. </p>
    <p> I am stoked that I have so much more of my life to explore the world with. :) </p>
